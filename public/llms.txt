# SimpleRedact

> Secure, client-side image redaction tool with browser-based AI text detection. Processing happens entirely on-device via WebGPU/WASM.

SimpleRedact is a privacy-first web application designed for one specific purpose: making sure sensitive data never leaves your computer. It combines manual redaction tools with the Florence-2 AI model for automated detection of PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

## Features
- **Zero-Trust**: No images are ever uploaded; all inference and pixelation occur in the browser.
- **AI-Powered**: Automates detection of emails, phone numbers, credit cards, and more.
- **High Performance**: Leverages WebGPU for fast, local AI inference.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source and community-driven.
