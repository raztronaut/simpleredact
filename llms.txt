# SimpleRedact

> Secure, client-side image redaction tool with browser-based AI text detection.

## Description
SimpleRedact is a privacy-first web application designed to redact sensitive information from images without ever uploading them to a server. It features manual drawing tools and an automated detection system powered by the Florence-2 AI model running locally via WebGPU or WASM.

## Core Features
- **Client-Side First**: All processing (redaction, AI detection) happens in the end-user's browser.
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Automates common PII identification (Email, Phone, Credit Cards, etc.).
- **Professional Tools**: Supports zoom, fit-to-screen, and precise coordinate-based redaction boxes.
- **Zero-Trust Metadata**: Privacy-focused approach with no tracking or external API dependencies for the core logic.

## Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite 6+, Tailwind CSS.
- **AI Engine**: @huggingface/transformers (Florence-2 model).
- **State Management**: Zustand (with history support for undo/redo).
- **Performance**: Heavy use of WebGPU for on-device inference.

## Project Structure
- `/src/components/editor`: Core redaction interface and canvas logic.
- `/src/components/upload`: Landing page and file ingestion.
- `/src/store`: Application state and history management.
- `/src/lib/aiService.ts`: Core AI integration and spatial analysis logic.
- `/src/utils`: Image processing and pixelation utilities.

## Key Relationships
- `ImageCanvas` -> `RedactionBox`: Drawing and interaction layer.
- `aiService` -> `DetectionReviewDialog`: AI detection flow and user review.
- `useStore` -> All Components: Centralized state for boxes, zoom, and image data.

## Documentation
See [README.md](README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
